import random

#random.seed(1) it will always give you same output as in my case it is generating 2 and 5 only,, easy for debugging
#  âœ… Use random.seed() â†’ when you want repeatable results (e.g., for testing or demos).

# ðŸš« Remove random.seed() â†’ when you want true randomness (e.g., for gameplay). bascically It will generate the same sequence of random numbers every time you run the program.
